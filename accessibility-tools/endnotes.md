## Contributors welcome!

This guide is written in Gitbooks to allow for easy collaboration. Additional contributors are welcome, either as writers or editors. It would be wonderful to create a series of easy to understand guides on accessibility. Topics could include deeper-dives into audio-visual accessibility and physical facilities accessibility. Anything that can make our library world more accessible would be welcome.

Version one of this guide was created by **Jerry Yarnetsky,** a Web Services Librarian at Miami University of Ohio. He can be reached at [jerry.yarnetsky@miamioh.edu](mailto:jerry.yarnetsky@miamioh.edu).
