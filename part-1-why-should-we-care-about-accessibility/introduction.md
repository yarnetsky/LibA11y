# 1.1 Why should we care about accessibility?

### Universal access provides greater than expected benefits

A student with hearing loss can obviously benefit from closed captioned video. So can a person who has issues differentiating spoken words from background noise. Yet many library videos are made with non-professional equipment and streamed over slower cell networks. In these instances, the sound quality of the video itself can suffer. Captioning walks in for the win!

### **Students are using the legal system to fight for equal access**

On the flip side, [dozens of colleges and universities across the United States are facing legal action](https://www.d.umn.edu/~lcarlson/atteam/lawsuits.html) over inaccessible technology and online resources. Having accessible content from the point of creation can save extensive time and effort spent on accessibility remediation \(and potentially save legal costs as well\).

### We're librarians!

> "We provide the highest level of service to **all library users** through appropriate and usefully organized resources; equitable service policies; **equitable access**; and accurate, unbiased, and courteous responses to all requests." â€” from [ALA Code of Ethics](http://www.ala.org/tools/ethics) \(emphasis for illustration\)

Providing universal access certainly makes sense from these perspectives, yet more importantly it helps us fulfill our ethical mission. As such, we should be at the front lines fighting for our patrons and students access to everything. **We're librarians! Access is our middle name.**

### **Fear not, the basics are easy**

While implementing advanced web accessibility can require development experience, making the basic content we all create accessible can be accomplished by us all.
