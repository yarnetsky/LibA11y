# 2.4 Hyperlinks

## Screen Reader Interaction

{% hint style="info" %}
Another method for skimming a webpage with a screen reader is to listen to all of the hyperlinks on the page.
{% endhint %}

## Solutions

### Better Links

* Link wording should clearly explain its destination and/or intent. Ambiguous phrasing can obscure a link's purpose.
* Read your links out of context to insure they will stand alone as a screen reader presents them in order.
* Avoid introductory phrases such as "click here" for a link.&#x20;
* Definitely do not use "click here" as a link on its own.
* Do not use raw web addresses in links as the screen reader will read it aloud the entire URL.

### Better Link Examples

* _**Poorly written link**_: [Click here](https://miamioh.edu/about-miami/visiting-miami/directions/index.html) for directions.
* _**Better**_: [Directions to Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/about-miami/visiting-miami/directions/index.html) are available online.
* _**Poorly written**_: Learn more about accessibility [here](http://webaim.org/standards/wcag/).
* _**Better**_: Learn more about [accessibility standards from WebAIM](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag).

## Testing

When reviewing WAVE's "Details" tab, look for alerts of "Suspicious Link Text" then click on the link alert icons to find the questionable links on your page. On this page WAVE identified the poorly written link examples above. The tool also identified redundant links from the examples above as well!
