description: A guide for making our library content accessible
---

# Introduction to LibA11y

In the library world, we create a lot of content. This short guide is designed to help content creators make this content accessible to everyone. In addition to explaining _how_ to make our content accessible, we'll aim to explain _why_ these methods are needed. We hope this makes universal access easier to implement. 

Part one explains the basics about web accessibility. Part two explains best practices for your content. Part three is a list of tools and resources. While the best practices will make more sense after reading part one, feel free to skip to the best practices as you need them.

First, why should we care?
