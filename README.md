# Introduction

In the library world, we create a lot of content. This short guide is designed to help content creators make this content accessible to everyone. In addition to explaining _how_ to make our content accessible, we'll aim to explain _why_ these methods are needed. We hope this makes universal access easier to implement.  

But first, why should we care?
