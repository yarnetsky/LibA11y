# Let's install a simple accessibility testing tool

In the next section, we'll outline strategies for creating accessible content. But first, let's try installing a simple tool that can help double check your work as you create this material. 

## Tota11y accessibility visualization tool

\*\*\*\*[**Tota11y**](http://khan.github.io/tota11y/) is a bookmarklet created by the Kahn Academy to help you visualize how your content is perceived by screen readers and other assistive technology. 

### Installation method 1: bookmarklet <a id="Installation"></a>

Do you keep your bookmarks bar visible in your browser? Simply click and hold the Tota11y link below, then drag the link from the box below into your bookmarks bar. To activate the tool, simply click the bookmark.

{% hint style="info" %}
\*\*\*\*[**Tota11y**](javascript:%28function%28%29{var%20tota11y=document.createElement%28'SCRIPT'%29;tota11y.type='text/javascript';tota11y.src='https://khan.github.io/tota11y/tota11y/build/tota11y.min.js';document.getElementsByTagName%28'head'%29[0].appendChild%28tota11y%29;}%29%28%29;)\*\*\*\*
{% endhint %}

### Installation method 2: Chrome extension

[Tota11y is also available as a Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tota11y-plugin-from-khan/oedofneiplgibimfkccchnimiadcmhpe/related). Install the extension, then click the eyeglasses icon in your toolbar to activate.

### Using Tota11y

4. You'll see a pop-up menu with choices such as Headers, Contrast, and Image alt-text. 
5. Clicking one of these options will provide information and screen annotations and track any errors.
6. Clicking the option a second time dismisses the report.
7. Clicking the glasses again minimizes the tool.

We will review these tools on the following pages as we talk about how to create better content.
