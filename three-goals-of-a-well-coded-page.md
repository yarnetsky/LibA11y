# Three goals of a well-coded page

Web accessibility has a set of standards called the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG 2.1\)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). It has dozens of specifications on topics from headers and links to colors and images. To better understand the intent of these specifications, let's group them into three goals.

## Goal 1: Page structure outlined

When first visiting a webpage, our student wants to quickly gain an outline of the page's purpose and content. As we noted, headings can provide our reader the page headlines. Headings can also provide an outline of the content's proper order. Thus, our page succeeds if the page's headings, content order, and links are well crafted. A poorly constructed page, on the other hand, is like trying to cook with an out of order recipe.

## Goal 2: Content meaning explained

All meaning our sighted readers would gain from our illustrated webpages should also be readily gained by patrons using assistive technologies. With screen readers not seeing our photos, we need alternative text to explain their purpose and content. Similarly, color-coded warnings should be heard as a warning even without the use of color. Thoughtful writing and a little help from our content management systems make these tasks easier.

## Goal 3: Interactive tools enabled and described

In addition to perceiving a page's structure and content, we also need to properly interact with the page. It's worth noting at this point that screen readers are most often controlled by keyboard commands. As such, we need to enable our site to be accessible by keyboard as well as by mouse or tap.

For example, a floating window pops-up asking if we want to sign up for a newsletter. We move our mouse to click the close button. With a screen reader, mousing to the close button is not an option. If the pop-up is correctly coded, the cursor will be captured so our reader can easily keyboard over to the close button as well. Incorrectly coded and our reader could be stuck behind a window that cannot be closed.

Once the interactivity is enabled, we also need to insure it's properly described. If you have four tabs of content, the site needs to tell the screen reader which of the four tabs is visible. Without description the screen reader simply cannot navigate these interactive features.

Happily, much of this functionality is built into modern website management systems such as LibGuides. However, we need to be alert to this issue so we can use these interactive elements effectively. Do our featured events need to be in a carousel? If so, then we need to insure the carousel is correctly coded.
