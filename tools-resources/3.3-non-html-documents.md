# C. Non-HTML documents

The concepts from web documents can also apply to other documents. However, the implementation may differ. Here are links for tips on making additional file types accessible

* [PDF files](http://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/)
* [Microsoft Word](http://webaim.org/techniques/word/) documents
* [PowerPoint](http://webaim.org/techniques/powerpoint/) presentations
* [Adobe Flash](http://webaim.org/techniques/flash/) content.

Recommendations for most of these formats echo those for webpages such as using headings to convey logical flow for a Word document and PDFs.
